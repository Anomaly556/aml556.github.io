# About us on Twitter

On Twitter, you can tweet content that you have created (details on the types and genres of content you post can be found here), retweet or embed retweets of content that other users have tweeted, and topics of discussion.

The time frame for responding to replies, tweets, and retweets is from about 11:45 AM to 05:30 PM. (This is the result of converting from Japan time to New York time zone.)

So we may not be able to respond at certain times of the day.
